# Primitive Validation
Java library which have leftovers Bean Validation Constraints for Primitive Types.

Library has constraints for validation of primitives types(regular primitives, String, File etc) in Java.
Currently it has following constraints:
1. Any: to validate string has any value in the set.
2. Contact: to validate string is valid contact number based on E164 format.
3. Email: to validate string is valid email.
3. Url: to validate string is valid http or https url.
4. FileType: to restrict multipart file in Spring MVC based on mime.

I will be adding more and more primitive constrains in near future.
